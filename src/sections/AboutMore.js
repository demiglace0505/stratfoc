        Stratfoc is the personal brand that I created. It is a portmanteau and
        stands for
        {<strong> Strategic Focus</strong>}, which is the discipline that I
        abide by in my endeavours. It is with this mantra that I am able to
        motivate myself to strive for greatness, recognize my passions, and
        serialize goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        The logo is an {<em>ens≈ç</em>} - a single, unbroken, creative
        brushstroke in an open circle which signifies an incessant pursuit for
        development, growth and ultimately, perfection.
